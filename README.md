### About Me

I build web applications with an analytical edge. As a self-taught Full Stack Developer, I focus on the trifecta of modern software: security, scalability, and maintainability. Because of my roots in Data Analysis, my work goes beyond basic CRUD functionality; I design intelligent backend services and APIs that effectively collect, process, and visualize data to drive business value.
